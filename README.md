# CodenameMooses

## Running
I'll soon provide an iso file in the releases tab. From source, you will need Visual Studio 2022 and Cosmos installed. I'm not sure if there will be any problems importing, but if there is, best solution is to just make a new project using Cosmos (C#) and put the Kernel.cs in there.

## Lore 
Is it weird to have an OS phase? Where you just obsess about various Operating Systems, mostly Windows, spend the night trying out VMs? Probably yes. But I had that. Multiple times. 
During quarantine, it hit its climax to the point where I wanted to make my own OS. I found Cosmos, and despite it not being that OS coding from scratch people think of, it was enough to keep me happy.
